 * ```yaml
 * 
 * {
 *     "type": "UIImage",
 *     "image_filepath": "data/textures/button_active.png",
 *     "dimensions": [620, 440],
 *     "anchor": [0.5, 0.5]
 * }
 * 
 * ```
 * 
 * To change the image associated with this aspect, call UIImage::updateImage(), passing the path to the file from which the new image is to be loaded.
