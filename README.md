# Game of Ur

## Project Description

### Introduction

This is a computer adaptation of [Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur), written in C++ using SDL and OpenGL.

Game of Ur is a competitive, two-player board game. The player who moves all 7 of their pieces to the end of the course first, wins the game.

### Motivation

Between July and November 2023, I spent some time studying C++, OpenGL and SDL by following the tutorials on [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) and [Lazy Foo](https://lazyfoo.net). With this project, I hope to cement my newly acquired skills.

I decided against making an original game because I wanted to focus on the technical aspects of game development, and not on game design. Adapting an existing game seemed like a good way to limit the scope of my first project.
